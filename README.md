# Simple Employee Managament System
This was a school assignment. It was to learn how to manage and manipulate linked lists with proper memory management in mind. It was also to teach how to create and manage proper directory structure as each function was encapsulated in a file.

***
It allowed for a text file that help employee information to be passed. It would then allow for data management.
This program has 8 functions.
